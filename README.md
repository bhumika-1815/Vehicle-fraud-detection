Vehicle insurance fraud includes deceptive claims made after
an accident, such as staged wrecks, bogus injuries, and
phantom passengers. Detecting and combating these
fraudulent tactics is critical for maintaining the insurance
process's fairness and integrity. There are 33 fields and 15,420
records in the dataset utilized for analysis, giving a solid basis
for spotting trends and anomalies connected to fraudulent
actions.

# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop an
effective machine learning model utilizing a motor vehicle
insurance dataset to accurately identify fraudulent
insurance claims, ensuring improved fraud detection and
enhancing the company's risk management capabilities.
As a team when we were discussing even before diving into
analysis and test, we had a look at the data set and thought
what are the factors that might define a case to be
fraudulent.
With our basic realizations we thought factors like Policy
Type, Type of vehicle, Presence of a witness, Age of vehicle
and agent type might be some of the factors. With this our
mind went ahead with our analysis to see if these were the
factors or were there any more that were going to get
added to this.
